## Spooky!
I was tired of installing Phantom/Nightmare/etc everytime I needed a page screenshot feature for my 12-factor apps. The 
**Blood Banya** is a dummy screenshot service that uses pool of Nightmare.js renderers to increase the rendering speed.
It can be self hosted. 

Stay tuned for more info! ðŸŽƒðŸ’€
